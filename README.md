Workbench
=========
#### A medium-data framework for security research and development teams.
The Workbench framework focuses on simplicity, transparency, and easy on-site customization.
As an open source python framework it provides light-weight task management, execution and pipelining for a loosely-coupled set of python classes. Adding your own code to Workbench is amazingly simple, please see our set of IPython notebooks below for examples.

### Pull the repository
<pre>

**Warning!: The repository contains malcious data samples, be careful, exclude the workbench directory from AV, etc...**

### Installing Workbench:
Please note the indexers 'Neo4j' and 'ElasticSearch' are optional. We strongly suggest you install both of them but we also appreciate that there are cases where that's not possible or feasible.

#### Mac/OSX
- brew install mongodb
- brew install yara
- brew install libmagic
- brew install bro
   - Put the bro executable in your PATH (/usr/local/bin or wherever bro is)

#### Ubuntu (14.04 and 12.04)
- sudo apt-get install mongodb
- sudo apt-get install python-dev
- sudo apt-get install g++
- sudo apt-get install libssl0.9.8
- Bro IDS: 
   - Put the bro executable in your PATH (/opt/bro/bin or wherever bro is)

    In general the Bro debian package files are WAY too locked down with dependencies on exact versions of libc6 and python2.6. We have a more 'flexible' version [Bro-2.2-Linux-x86_64_flex.deb](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workbench-data/packages/Bro-2.2-Linux-x86_64_flex.deb). 
    - sudo dpkg -i Bro-2.2-Linux-x86_64_flex.deb
 
   If using the Debian package above doesn't work out:
   - Check out the Installation tutorial [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-install-bro-ids-2-2-on-ubuntu-12-04)
   - or this one [here](http://www.justbeck.com/getting-started-with-bro-ids/)
   - or go to offical Bro Downloads [www.bro.org/download/](http://www.bro.org/download)

    
###Install Indexers:

#### Mac/OSX
- brew install elasticsearch
- pip install -U elasticsearch
- brew install neo4j
    - Note: You may need to install Java JDK 1.7 [Oracle JDK 1.7 DMG](http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/7u51-b13/jdk-7u51-macosx-x64.dmg) for macs.

#### Ubuntu (14.04 and 12.04)
- Neo4j: See official instructions for Neo4j [here](http://www.neo4j.org/download/linux)
    - Note: You may need to install Java JDK 1.7. If you have Java 1.7 installed , and error says otherwise, run update-alternatives --config java and select Java 1.7

- ElasticSearch:
    - wget https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.2.1.deb
    - sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-1.2.1.deb

#### Python Modules:
Note: Workbench is continuously tested with python 2.7. We're currently working on Python 3 support ([Issue 92](https://github.com/SuperCowPowers/workbench/issues/92)).

* cd workbench
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* Go have a large cup of coffee...


### Running It:
#### Server (localhost or server machine)
<pre>
$ cd workbench/server
$ python -O workbench.py
</pre>
#### Example Clients (use -s for remote server)
There are about a dozen example clients showing how to use workbench on pcaps, PEfiles, pdfs, and log files. We even has a simple nodes.js client (looking for node devs to pop some pull requests :).
<pre>
$ cd workbench/clients
$ python simple_workbench_client.py [-s tcp://mega.server.com]
</pre>

### Testing:
Unit testing and sub-pipeline tests
<pre>
$ cd workbench/server/workers
$ ./runtests
</pre>
      
Full pipeline tests (clients exercise a larger set of components)
<pre>
$ cd workbench/clients
$ ./runtests
</pre>

### Benign Error
We have no idea why occasionaly you see this pop up in the server output. To our knowledge it literally has no impact on any functionality or robustness. If you know anything about this please help us out by opening an issue and pull request. :)
<pre>
ERROR:zerorpc.channel:zerorpc.ChannelMultiplexer, unable to route event:
_zpc_more {'response_to': '67d7df3f-1f3e-45f4-b2e6-352260fa1507', 'zmqid':
['\x00\x82*\x01\xea'], 'message_id': '67d7df42-1f3e-45f4-b2e6-352260fa1507',
'v': 3} [...]
</pre>
### VirusTotal Warning
The vt_query.py worker uses a shared 'low-volume' API key provided by SuperCowPowers LLC. When running the vt_query worker the following warning happens quite often:

    "VirusTotal Query Error, no valid response... past per min quota?"
If you'd like to use the vt_query worker on a regular basis, you'll have to put your own VirusTotal API key in the workbench/server/config.ini file.

#### Git Development Model
We're going to use the 'GitHub Flow' model.

- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master (ie:new-oauth2-scopes)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
- When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request
- After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master
